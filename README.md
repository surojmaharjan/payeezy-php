# Payeezy API Client Library for PHP
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ndubbaka/payeezy-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ndubbaka/payeezy-php)
## Description
Payeezy PHP SDK is built to make developers life easy to integrate with the Payeezy API (https://developers.payeezy.com) for processing payements with various payment methods. Download the SDK, follow instructions to start testing against the sandbox environment with developer credentials.
## Installation ##

You can use **Composer** or simply **Download the Release**

### Composer

The preferred method is via [composer](https://getcomposer.org). Follow the
[installation instructions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) if you do not already have
composer installed.

Once composer is installed, execute the following command in your project root to install this library:

```sh
composer require payeezy/payeezy-php:dev-master
```

Finally, be sure to include the autoloader:

```php
require_once '/path/to/your-project/vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Download the Release

If you abhor using composer, you can download the package in its entirety. The [Releases](https://github.com/ndubbaka/payeezy-php/releases) page lists all stable versions. Download any file
with the name `payeezy-php-[RELEASE_NAME].zip` for a package including this library and its dependencies.

Uncompress the zip file you download, and include the autoloader in your project:

```php
require_once '/path/to/payeezy-php/vendor/autoload.php';
```
## Examples ##
See the [`examples/`](examples) directory for examples of the key client features. You can
view them in your browser by running the php built-in web server.

```
$ php -S localhost:8000 -t examples/
```

And then browsing to the host and port you specified
(in the above example, `http://localhost:8000`).

### Basic Example ###

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Payeezy_Client();
$client->setApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY");
$client->setApiSecret("YOUR_API_SECRET");
$client->setMerchantToken("YOUR_MERCHANT_TOKEN");
$client->setUrl("https://api-cert.payeezy.com/v1/transactions");

$card_transaction = new Payeezy_CreditCard($client);

$response = $card_transaction->purchase([
  "merchant_ref" => "Astonishing-Sale",
  "amount" => "1299",
  "currency_code" => "USD",
  "credit_card" => array(
    "type" => "visa",
    "cardholder_name" => "John Smith",
    "card_number" => "4788250000028291",
    "exp_date" => "1020",
    "cvv" => "123"
  )
]);
echo "<pre>";
var_dump($response);
echo "</pre>";
```
